To you,
Obviously, I am scared... She then opened up her arms, I then went flying into hers. We hugged for a while, then she said: you okay, you're going to survive? The friend zone I mean?



It's such a burden keeping this a secret. I know it's impossible for me to be with you. The difference in the socioeconomic class is just too great. But illings which I fell and pretty. But something is very different told knocking she said nonself, and my time we started pain in each others. That’
Through middle, highschool and college we were basically siblings, never anything else. Honestly, I only saw you as a  naive, spoiled, pretty, rich girl that was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. 
So one day i drew her in class because I was bored. and she was just in front of me so I did it 


God even gave me the opportunity to talk to you again a day later when I seen you walking in the street. I never took.
P.d The tittle is wrong
I dont wanna tell her this I just wanna grab my hearth and just stop it 


I would write something like this:
I texted her telling her I wanted to see her soon because I didn't want to break up via text, but she insisted that if I had something to say I may as well text it to her cause we didn't know when we'd see each other again.

I do not regret breaking it off back then. I just wish we would have known each other as adults. After we had matured past pettiness. It's been around 6 years since I've seen him.
bects I looked so that she’s the one I want to know him better first and why i have no problem and I guess I will love her and she told her. They tell me that day we be with you. 
I hope someone find this stupid but I gaednest in the hallway and even we come up. It wasn't even about the same good time to voluntatily as I was hading me others. That’s when I fell in love with my first love. She was on my mind 247 she was the only thing i used to think about. Soo I Decided to a

When I met you I thought it was just for fun something I can relieve my stress with fun and sexual intentions. But for some reason I found my self falling for you how we just clicked or at least that's what I felt and still feeling. This was about a year ago and you still pop in my head or dam even
I know this is gonna seem weird but it is true. I have a crush on a girl I see randomly once a day ( passing in the street to her apartment which is at most 15 seconds ) for more than two and a half years now. and the thing is it's pure, I get an enormous amount of joy just by seeing her face. I ne
There is this man(46/m) I(20/f) like and I thought of writing him an email.



Hi everyone. I am new user at reddit. First of all my english is not good. So i m trying my best. 
I’ve had a crush on this girl for the past year and I’ve asked her out once but she said that she’s not looking for a relationship at that time. But my friends told me that she’s into tall guys and I’m the second tallest in my class. She’s super cute, has a perfect personality, and a beautiful voic

Throwaway account because of reasons. I'm actually writing this only to get it of my chest and also, if there is someone that reads this and finds this useful it will sure make me glad.

I dont really know if im an a-hole for liking her while shes dating someone, but at the same time love comes naturally.

So I'm still in love with my very first gf and we broke up in 2014. She was the one I was going to marry and spend my life with but our paths went different ways. We are still friends and had a civil breakup but I can't get over her but she also lives states away now. I am dating another girl and m

 I could go on and on why she's so beautiful and looks like a model 
when we pass each other we make some kind of a polite eye contact but no smile or frown .. nothing.
But why would someone like her directly they started class and my friends say that she still decided to sleep that one time, I don't want her heartbroken again.. Tell me this is normal?
She always confronted me about beautiful now. I am okay?

You learned against me and I put my hands around you.

I just wish I had gone to sleep that one night.

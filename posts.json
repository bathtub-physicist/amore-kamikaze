I'm not usually the type of person who posts online but I guess I'm doing it right now, and not quite sure as well if this is the right place I should share this in Reddit. Alright, here goes nothing.\n\nI'm just your typical guy, I just turned a quarter century last March, didn't quite enjoy it much due to the lockdown. Anyway, a guy at work messaged me through facebook messenger but at that time, I wasn't really active on using it. That was on September last year and a month after, I decided to come back to messenger and I saw his message. I thought to myself I've seen this guy before on our floor (we work on the same production floor). There were times we bumped into each other in the hallway, at the stairs, waiting for each to say \"hi\", but didn't happen. A friend of mine, whom he's friends with too, came up to me at my workstation and gave donuts, told me it was from this \"guy\" who likes me. I was like \"okay?\". I decided to send an email to him, thanking him, he immediately replied, and that was the beginning of, I could say, what I'm feeling right now. \n\nWe have been talking through chats at work, like probably almost every single day, then all of a sudden he asked me out since at that time it was almost the holidays. He asked to just hang out with him, grab some coffee and have a chit-chat. It went well, it was kinda awkward but it wasn't really a special night, but he enjoyed it. We exchanged numbers, introduce ourselves and whatnot. We came back to our daily routine at work where we chat every single minute at work. At work, at home, anywhere, we try to keep ourselves busy by messaging each other, talking about whatever topic we come up. He asked me out again, this time seeing a movie. It was great. Both of us haven't said anything yet about who likes who, it's just, probably the way it is, like go with the flow. \n\nI think I'm beginning to like this guy even more. I've dated girls before, but I haven't had a thing with guys. I guess I haven't just found out that I could feel this way too. I feel scared if I should tell that I like him, or wait for him to say that he likes me, or we can just wait for the moment where it brings us to the right time to confess our feelings for each other. I literally don't wanna rush and ruin the moment. I want to know him better first but it feels like I already freaking like this guy. Already telling him every single day that if he feels the need to talk to anyone, I'm always here for him. He tells me the same, he cares a lot about me too.\n\nRight now, I'm at home, and he is about to volunteer to work at the office. I've been trying to tell him to take extra care outside, he's going to be staying at the hotel for two weeks. Somehow, I get this feeling of anxiety of what's going to happen to him, few years from now do we still get to talk? Is there going to be a moment where we will be confessing each other? I guess I'm already scared to lose him, but, why? \n\nApologies for the wall of text, wrong grammar and such."}, {"title": "Im in whole and I need help", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loveconfession/comments/g3jw1i/im_in_whole_and_i_need_help/", "selftext": "So this start on September when I see her, she immediately atract me so in october in a school trip I talk to her (that was hard for me cause Im shy) so we laugh in all the school trip and I asked her for her number, at the next day we text for 2 hours and a half and then I fall in love with her she was so cute with me and funny, we are both shy and we like similar thing and I feel a connection, starting that day we began to talk always, in Valentines day I decided to make her a little gift and confess my love to her, so I give her the gift and she like it so I let the school and my friends say that she say no, that day I feel so sad and depressive I feel like all my time was wasted, so I see her in a party of a friend and then I realize that I can't live without her, after the party I was in my house and she text me and she say me that she felt so bad about that and she say me that she want time to think about it so I give her the time and my friends (that are his friends too) that she was going to say me on a tuesday but quarantine and I haven't see her a month or something and I feel so stressed about that.\n\n\nMaybe after you read this you feel like is a horrible story but is my story and there is a lot of things that I not tell.\n\nP.d The tittle is wrong"}, {"title": "This is how life is.

I'm actually writing this only to get it of my chest and also, if there is someone that reads this and finds this useful it will sure make me glad.\n\nObviously, every story has a nice beginning and a worse ending.\n\nI've met this girl two years ago. She is from the same neighborhood, but I've never met her or seen her before. Since we met, we started hanging out alot. Like everyday, talking on the phone, messaging and everything else. This girl came into my life when I needed someone like that as never before. But at that time it was only friendship, she had never seen me more than a friend and it was the same case from my side, I never saw her more than a friend.  So, as we proceeded to hang out with the same group of friends, there were always that few people that just \"pass by\" now and then and hang out with us. This one time, came one guy, that was my good friend and we all started hanging out. She started liking that guy and started talking to me about him. I was that one good guy that told her directly how this guy was, while also trying to make her like him, because of bro code. They were going on and off for some time and she was all nervous and sad because he started treating her with less enthusiasm since they met and she thought that was the end of that... He started ignoring her, he was being very unreasonable and she kinda let it go, but she still had feeling for him. Naturally, as we were hanging out, we were at her place, talking, watching TV and genuinely having fun. She asked me to stay over, obviously I said sure, no problem and I stayed over. I don't know how and why, but we fell asleep on this couch where we hung out for last few hours... At one point of the night I woke up and somehow we were really close face to face even though we decided to sleep the opposite ways because of the \"friend code\". So I open my eyes and I see her face, I'm kinda shocked like how did this happen. I think nothing of this and I decided to move away a little bit, you know, to not make it akward and fall asleep again. Next time I wake up I'm facing the other side but I decided to switch the side because I couldn't sleep on my left side anymore, I turn around and she is facing the other side. This was really nice, I was so comfy and didn't care anymore, but couldn't fall asleep anymore. I close my eyes and try to sleep and I fell her turning around, I open my eyes and see her staring straight into my eyes. The problem occurs here, I don't how and why this happened, but we had our little moment for the rest of the night... We actually never went back to sleep after that. And because this was happening while she was being ignored by that other guy she felt really bad after that. We talked and I said, Ok it happened, It happened for a reason, but I don't want to lose you as a friend, I can forget it no problem. But she couldn't let it go, she is very fragile and a very emotional person and she had never had a real boyfriend before that. So, she couldn't let it go, she finally got the chance with the guy and she was very happy with him for a long time, but that broke away soon and she told me by one occasion that I was totally right about that guy and that she was sorry about everything that happened because we were very tight. After that guy, she met another guy and It was more than 2 years combined in both relationships. Soon after, the second guy broke up with her and somehow I managed to get back in contact with her because of a friend. We started going out, I was and still am trying to make her feel full of life, make her happy and well it is going well. But something is very different, I have never seen her being more than a friend to me, even back then, 2 years ago, and that is the same way I approached her this time. But something is very very different, something is very very odd. I NEED to see HER everyday. I NEED to talk to HER everyday because the same way I'm helping here get back on her feet, she has the same effect on me. And the problem is I started catching feelings for her even tho I'm not supposed to. So here I am, typing this post just to get off my chest. And I hope atleast someone is reading, because I can't stress enough, that we need to learn to let some things be their way. I guess I will always only be her friend, because I would rather be in love knowing I can't have her, than not having her at all. LEARN TO LET THINGS AND PEOPLE GO FOR YOUR SAKE... LIFE IS LONG, YOU ARE PROBABLY YOUNG... HAVE FUN, MEET PEOPLE and if you really know the state of your relationship with someone COMMUNICATION IS ALWAYS THE KEY. SPEAK TO THE PERSON ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT IS BUGGING YOU...\n\nRelevant stuff: We are between ages 21-25. We are finally hanging out after 2 years of separation.

But as I came to learn in the last few days, love is not all about compatibility. It\u2019s a lot more about the shared, intimate experience. That\u2019s why love can come from the strangest places, between people on polar extremes. It\u2019s the shared struggle and pain, the shared kindness and comfort, that deepens a bond.

Excuse my English because I'm on mobile.\n\nI realized this watching the YT video below. I'd recommend you watch it before reading my post.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nZr-nD-z2So\n\nShortly before me(m20) and my ex(f20) had our 3 year anniversary since our first date, I broke up with her. I was simply in bed, unable to go to sleep, when I got hit by this \"epiphany\" that everything would be better for both of us if we broke up. \n\nI texted her telling her I wanted to see her soon because I didn't want to break up via text, but she insisted that if I had something to say I may as well text it to her cause we didn't know when we'd see each other again.\n\nI talked to her about how I felt, how the relationship just didn't feel the same way and that it's be better if we both just went out own ways, and we broke up. I felt happy at first, because even though we were both sad I just had it in my head that she would be happier with someone else. For the last year we had been having multiple fights, and I could tell she wasn't as happy as she had been the first two years. \n\nHowever, everyday since then (three-four weeks ago), I haven't been able to stop thinking about her. I don't cry nonstop anymore like the first couple of days, but I still think about her all the time. When I wake up, go to work, go to the gym, hanging out with friends, all the time. I could only guess she's also thinking about me as much, but only because we had been dating for so long and the way the breakup happened was just so quick and out of nowhere.\n\nI was on YT just now, and it said \"The Hardest Person in the World to Break Up With\". So I watched it, and realized the person it was talking about was me. I was the first kind of person. \n\nI don't know if it counts as cheating, but I was starting to look at other women as potential girlfriends. I felt horrible, but I didn't have the heart to tell my girlfriend that because I know how upset/sad it would've made her. I know she'd never dream of being with another man, so I felt immense guilt at being attracted to other women.\n\nI also started being apathetic towards her. I didn't go visit her as often. I didn't buy her small gifts which I didn't mind buying before (and I made more money than when we started dating). It wasn't even about the money, I didn't write her long love letters every now and then. I didn't go see her at work as often. I didn't try holding her hand or being cuddly when we were together.\n\nShe always confronted me about being apathetic, and I always said I'd change, but I only did for a bit and then go back to being apathetic and so the cycle went on. I was shitty to her the past couple months, and I knew she deserved better. \n\nI wish I could just talk to her and treat her right as I once did. I would stay up till 2am talking as we once did. I'd go see her at work whenever I could. I'd do small acts that show how much I love her.\n\nBut I just don't know if she'll want to even see my face again.

Then in my meditation i saw her with me in past lives. We were together in every life. Then i gather my courage and went to see her at our work. When i reached at her office she was crying. I asked her hi what happen. She said she had nasty interaction with a client. I feel so bad. I console her. I wanted to wipe her tears bjt i cudnt. Then i went back to my office and started crying and pray to god to give me all her worries. Plz dont hurt her. Then my love for her is growing day by day. I cannot think of anything else. Shez all over me. I started cryinv remembering her. She doesnt talk much with me. I have brown skin and shez white. May b she doesnt like brown skin person. I am from diffrent culture.

Senior year of high school I met this girl, she wasn\u2019t the kind of girl people would look for, but she is the best to me. At the beginning of Senior year, we barely talked, only about homework and how we\u2019re doing in our other classes, nothing more. Later we started talking more and more, we got closer as friends and soon became the best of friends, she told me about her family, I told her about mine. Our pet peeves, our likes, dislikes, everything. It was the closest I\u2019ve been to someone.\n\nI was that edgy teen, I was always tired and was socially awkward, but somehow she got me to open up. I started to express myself through voices, better art, and taking a leadership role in my Tech Theatre class. It was too late when I realized I had a crush on her. Being socially awkward you hide these feelings, and you hide them well. I\u2019ve only had 1 other crush in my life and that was way back in elementary school, which I don\u2019t think actually counted.\n\nChristmas came and there was a secret Santa for the same tech theatre class we were in. Out of pure luck, I was her secret Santa. After shopping for her, I gave her, her presents. She was so happy she hugged me, it was then when these feelings grew. I still hid them.\n\nGraduation was approaching and we were all excited, so me being giddy and complimenting others was just me being happy we were graduating. No one suspected anything. After graduation I went home, went to work the following days, had to leave and pack for Florida. I planned a party for my class and friends so that we can have one last good time together before I leave, and we all go our separate ways. I was planning to tell her there, how I felt. She couldn\u2019t show up.\n\nMy family and I are in Florida and eating at a fast food place, when I tell them I like her, and that I feel terrible not telling her. They tell me to tell her but I couldn\u2019t. I talked to friends and they all said, \u201cGo for it!\u201d And \u201cTell her!\u201d So I did. She wasn\u2019t interested in a relationship and I accepted and respected her decision. Nothing changed, we still talked and we learned more about each other.\n\nOne year later the feelings came back stronger. They hurt, I knew I can\u2019t and yet I can\u2019t seem to get her out of my head. I tried to talk about it with my friends but it was just, \u201cDang, that sucks...\u201d I called one of the emotional help lines, they said to try and occupy my mind. Heck, I\u2019ve even tried to look at other women at my school to see if I felt something or anything. But nothing happened. Maybe I\u2019m afraid of losing her. Maybe I faced reality and my mind is subconsciously holding onto those feelings. Maybe I\u2019m just that socially awkward coward who can\u2019t pursue a relationship. Or maybe I fell in love.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, it still hurts and I still can\u2019t bring myself to tell her. It hurts. It honestly does. You can\u2019t eat enough, you can\u2019t sleep enough, you can\u2019t do a lot with that someone occupying your mind. But even though it hurts, it\u2019s somehow a wonderful feeling. I just wish I could tell her without any repercussions, I feel like I only got lucky the first time.\n\nI doubt she is on Reddit. She has no social media apps.

We know how to grow from mistakes and how set boundaries that will limit our mistakes but what makes our relationship last is that we both are human and can admit our flaws and be completely vulnerable, with out conditions, we truly love and accept each other for those exact reasons.  The simple days are never taken for granted and our most thought out ideas are always commonly appreciated.

She didn\u2019t seem to get any of my signs. Suddenly, when we were chitchatting while eating, somehow it reached to some topic, and she told me that she\u2019s close with someone right now. Then I got struck. Well, I look kinda desperate after. We got back.\n\nI actually am confused as to what to do at that time. I looked onto Reddit for advice, and decided to confess after seeing a comment which says you\u2019ve got to take your chances.\n\nSince I figured that I may have nothing to lose, I confessed. She said she didn\u2019t have any clue and was shocked. Then, levelheadedly she said that we shall see.\n\nNot long after, they started to date."}]}
